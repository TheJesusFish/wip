
Konix Roms
''''''''''

MSU Roms are as we received them, however the P88 roms had to built from the sources we had, the assembler used
was written from scratch since a compatible assembler could not be found when I did my initial search.
All roms in this package are provided with the kind permission of the original programmer(s), most of the
roms do very little, they were intended as programming examples for other developers to follow.


KONIX_ATTACK_OF_THE_MUTANT_CAMELS_V0_4
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is an early build of probably the most requested Konix Rom of all time. 

Quoted from the www.yakyak.org forums - From the original programmer, Mr Jeff Minter himself :

"Just been playing it. Weird to be playing something I was more or less certain I'd never see ever again! 

Sound's choppy on my rig (5 years old anyway, long in the tooth by now) but the gameplay is probably smoother than the original! IIRC I still had some optimisation to do to get to 60Hz constantly on the real hardware, and the emulator in its current state gives the graphics a helping hand.

You have unlimited lives and there aren't levels implemented yet, and there's only a few ships and the camels implemented, but you can at least fly around, shoot stuff, collect bonuses and the Neutronium Pellet, and try out the ship's different weapons.

Very cool to be able to see it all again! Very good work guys, and I'm really pleased that people will be able to at least have a look and a play with this old game that I thought was lost and gone forever ."

This was a rom designed to sit in the development kit and wait for a PC to send it data, which it would then run - Does nothing under emulation!
